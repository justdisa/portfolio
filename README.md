What I've been up to lately: A collection of projects, fascinations, obsessions, and rabbit holes.

Favicon made by Bogdan Rosu from www.flaticon.com (In the final product, attribution must be viewer-facing. Perhaps on the about page?)

User Stories: MVP

Let these user stories guide your development:

As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.

As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.

As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.

As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.

As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.

As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.

As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

<<<User Stories: Stretch Goals (not required, adapt to fit your portfolio's design)

As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.>>>
